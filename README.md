# getting-and-cleaning-data-week-4-project
Repository for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" Week 4 project. It contains the R code, the codebook, and output tidy data set for the assignment.
Files:
CodeBook.md describes the data, the variables, the calculations and all transformations and work that I did to clean up the provided data.
run_analysis.R contains all the code used to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. The code can be launched after importing it in RStudio. 
The performed tasks are:
1.	Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
output_tidydata.txt is the output of the final step
